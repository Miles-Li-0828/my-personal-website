<h1>The Battle Within: Grappling with a Life-Changing Choice</h1>

<p>Hi visitors, I'm grad you cliked in this blog, this is my first blog ever in my life and this website! If you've
    browsed through the homepage or the "About Me" section of this site, you probably know that I am an
    international student from China, currently studying in Australia. My major is Computing and Software Systems, a
    field that many people praise for its job opportunities and high earning potential. However, reality has hit me
    hard, showing me the challenges of pursuing this path. My ultimate goal is to stay in Melbourne after graduation,
    whether for the working environment or other personal reasons, and that means achieving permanent residency (PR).
    Unfortunately, sticking with IT doesn’t guarantee me a job, let alone PR.</p>

<p>The truth is, I’m genuinely passionate about technology, programming, and cybersecurity. But circumstances have
    pushed me to a crossroads:</p>

<ul style="color: #bbfbb0;">
    <li>Should I change my career path, choosing something more practical for securing PR but giving up what I love?
    </li>
    <li>Or should I continue pursuing my interests, even if it means taking on a higher risk of failure?</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I still have one year before graduation, I need to decide early. It’s one of the toughest dilemmas I’ve
    faced in my life.</p>

<p>After much contemplation, I’ve made my decision. I’ve chosen the conservative route, at least for now. I plan to
    enroll in a one-year carpentry course at TAFE after I finish my Bachelor degree and work in that field first. It’s a
    practical step toward securing PR and achieving financial independence. While it feels like a detour from my
    original dreams, this path might allow me to reconsider my career choices with more stability in the future.</p>

<p>As a Chinese individual, this decision was particularly difficult. In traditional Chinese culture, this decision is
    like "start strong but lose momentum", blue-collar jobs are often viewed as less prestigious than white-collar
    roles. I used to share that mindset until I experienced a shift in perspective. This ingrained belief was the root
    of much of my inner turmoil, clouding my ability to think rationally.</p>

<p>Reflecting on life, I realised that we often idealise our futures when we’re young. Many of us dream of becoming
    superheroes or achieving extraordinary success, but as adults, how many of us actually live out those dreams? In
    Chinese culture, academic success is seen as the ultimate key to life’s rewards. I was a victim of this belief.
    Without boasting, I’ve maintained excellent grades from primary school through university, believing that good
    scores would guarantee a smooth path forward. But reality proved me wrong. Despite my achievements, I struggled to
    secure internships last year, receiving little to no responses despite countless applications. That experience
    shattered my illusion of a "scoring dream."</p>

<p>This harsh reality taught me an important lesson: sometimes, making the right choice is more crucial than sheer
    effort. This insight is what led me to realize why pursuing carpentry might be a better short-term option for
    achieving PR compared to continuing in IT.</p>

<p>Now, I feel enlightened. No matter which path you choose, it will lead you to real life. Life rarely unfolds the way
    we imagine it will. At the end of this blog, I want to leave you with this thought: don’t trap yourself in a small
    mental cage built by traditional mindsets or rigid expectations. It will only limit your growth. Embrace your
    mediocrity, but never bow to life. Keep living and striving forward!</p>
